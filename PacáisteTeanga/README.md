Version 0.0

I am writing this package in Irish. I'm doing it because I love Irish and I'd like to see it enjoy more use online.
I do not think there is a lot of code written in Irish, but I'd loike to help change that, even in a little way.

Generally, the goal of this package is simple: to use language packs more easily in applications
Specifically, the package has a few funcitons
	To load language files
	To link the same phrases in different languages together from language file data
	To quickly change languages and to display the changes immediately

You may use this package freely, but plese give me credit.

Have fun!
